## Using Hyphen Delimited Strings
This is a pretty standard CSS naming convention, as it is consistent with the CSS property names. It is arguably more readable.

```
red-box{
  border: 1px solid red;
  font-size: 12pt;
}
```

## BEM

BEM stands for **B**lock, **E**lement, **M**odifiers.
`.stick-man` - Block 

`__head` - Element

`--blue` - Modifiers

Use `BEM` for more involved user interfaces. Use hyphen delimeter class names

Use `js-*` for class names that are attatched to JavaScript elements.
