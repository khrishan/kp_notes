    "#### 1. Create a virtual environment for a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd project_folder\n",
    "virtualenv --no-site-packages venv\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "The name of the virtual environment (in this case, it was `venv`) can be anything; omitting the name will place the files in the current directory instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "‘venv’ is the general convention used globally. As it is readily available in ignore files (eg: .gitignore’)\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a copy of Python in whichever directory you ran the command in, placing it in a folder named venv.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left of the prompt (e.g. `(venv)Your-Computer:project_folder UserName$`) to let you know that it’s active. From now on, any package that you install using `pip` will be placed in the `venv` folder, isolated from the global Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. If you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can deactivate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "`deactivate`"
