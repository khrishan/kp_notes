# Python Notes

These are my Python 3 notes.

The majority of these notes were made whilst I was working through the **Python : The Complete Python Developer Course** on Udemy.

In addition, if there are any other notes that I think would be useful and beneficial - I will add them in this section of the repo also.

Link for the course can be found by clicking [here](https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course).
