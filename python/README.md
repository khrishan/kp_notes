# Python Notes

These are my `Python3` notes.

The majority of these notes were made whilst I was working through the **Python : The Complete Python Developer Course** on Udemy. If I have used any other resources, then I will have supplied the reference(s).

Link for the course can be found by clicking [here](https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course).

I ran a docker container with Jupyter installed (for the benefit that when these notes are in Github, you can see them). In order to run the docker container, use the command below :

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 --name kp_notes_python -v "$PWD":/home/jovyan/work/ jupyter/datascience-notebook
```

To open the Jupyter notebook, use your browser and navigate to :

```bash
http://localhost:8888
```

I will provide an overal summary to the notes, but should you wish to look deeper into the notes that I made during the course, use the links below :
