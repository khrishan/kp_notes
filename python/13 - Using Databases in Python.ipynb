    "SQL was developed from Edgar F. Codd's work on relational databases in the 1970s, and became an ANSI standard in 1986.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSI (American National Standards Institute) is the primary organization for fostering the development of technology standards in the United States. (bearing in mind they thought they ruled the world)\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLLite has been around since 2000 and is a very fast and very stable stand-alone database. In fact, it's the most widely deployed database engine in the world. It's actually close to being the most widely deployed piece of software of any kind."
